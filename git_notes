## Git general navigational notes and commands ##
# git's SSH uses port 22 (and Gordon's network malfunction only allows port 80 [and I believe 443] to work), therefore git commands must be called outside of the campus network, e.g. through a hotspot. Here are some of the basic commands we'll be using

git checkout -b <branch>	# create branch
git checkout <branch>		# switches branches
git <rollback or something...>	# rollback changes
git revert <branch_num>		# revert pushed changes

.gitignore 			# list files to ignore changes from, whenever merging
